I have solved an exercise on FreeCodeCamp and downloaded the solution, that comes in json format.
Now I wanted it to edit it back in Javascript format and did not know how to convert it back. 
Then I found the solution:

-In index.js I am parsing the json to be able to edit it in Javascript again (in Visual Studio Code).
-I run node index.js in the Git Bash (Command Line) and it throws an error.
-I go back (to Visual Studio Code) and change all of the \n to \\n and it works! (ctrl + h, replace all)
-There is the original Javascript function I have solved displayed on my Terminal now.
-I copy my original function from the terminal into index.js and continue editing it!
