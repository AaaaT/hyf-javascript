Step 2: Git homework
Deadline Wednesday

Git homework for this week:

Pair up with another student in your class. The homework requires two people to work together. Let's call them admin and user.

admin creates a new repository on github called animals.
admin adds a file called “zoo.txt” with some animals generally found in a zoo.
admin commits and pushes the changes (in master branch).
user forks the repository created by admin and bring it to their machine (covered during classwork).
user makes a new branch called user-dev.
user adds another file called “pets.txt” with some animals generally found in a home.
user commits and pushes his branch to remote.
user creates a pull request(PR) to merge changes from user's user-dev branch to admin's master branch.
admin reviews the pull request and approves and merges changes.
