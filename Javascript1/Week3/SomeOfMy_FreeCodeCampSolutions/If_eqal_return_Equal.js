// There are many Comparison Operators in JavaScript. All of these operators return a boolean true or false value.
// The most basic operator is the equality operator ==. The equality operator compares two values and returns true if they're equivalent or false if they are not. 
// **Note that equality is different from assignment (=), which assigns the value at the right of the operator to a variable in the left.**

// Setup
function testEqual(val) {
    if (val== 12) { // Change this line //REMEMBER SYNTAX!!
      return "Equal";
    }
    return "Not Equal";
  }
  
  // Change this value to test
  testEqual(12);
