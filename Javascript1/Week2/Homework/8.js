// 8. Write a program that checks the types of two variables and prints out SAME TYPE if they are the same type.

// 8.1 First declare at least four variables and assign them different data types.

// 8.2 For each variable write a console.log statement that logs the value

// let foo = 3;
// console.log("The value of my variable foo is: " + foo);

// 8.3 Now write a console.log statement wherein you first explain in words what you think the type of your variables is.

// 8.4 Now use typeof to log the actual type of your variables.

// 8.5 Now compare the types of your different variables with one another.

// 8.6 Make sure to also show a message when the variables you are comparing are not the same type.
